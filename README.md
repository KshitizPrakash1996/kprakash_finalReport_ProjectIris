# kprakash_finalReport_ProjectIris
In this project - I took one Iris dataset, then “compare and contrast” it with three different ML models. I also tuned hyperparameters of one of the model using GridSearchCV(). And then Performed PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and visualized the result using ROC curves and Confusion matrices.
